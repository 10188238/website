<p> Comment of the hotel:
Dear Mr. Jose Garrote,

Thank you very much for your feedback.

We are happy to know that you satisfied with your stay with us and especially with our staff, amenities and clearness of your suite.

Yes, indeed at this stage we are unable to offer our guests a dinner on property due the technical reasons. We work hard to find a good solution to change this situation. However, we offer our guest a delivery service from many restaurants with variable cousins (during the opening hours of the restaurants). Our Concierge Service is more than happy to make a reservation in any restaurant around the hotel or to arrange an online order.

For now we are wishing you a lovely day.

Lotte, Guest Relations </p>
